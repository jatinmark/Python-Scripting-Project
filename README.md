Game Directory Manager: Automated Game Compilation and Execution in Go
Overview
The Game Directory Manager script is a Python tool designed to automate the process of managing, compiling, and executing Go-based games stored in specific directories. This script searches for game directories, compiles the Go code files, and runs the games, while also generating metadata in the form of a JSON file. The script allows users to quickly and efficiently handle multiple games from a large directory.
